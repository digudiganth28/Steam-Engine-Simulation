# Steam-Engine-Simulation using OpenGL
The aim of this project is to create a STEAM ENGINE. The Engine is made up of a Piston, Engine Pole, Cylinder Head, Flywheel, Crank Bell and a Crank. The viewer is  allowed to rotate the Engine’s Crank either in clock wise or in anti-clock wise direction.  The viewer can also slow up or slow down the Crank speed



The controls are:-
1. ‘a’ - > To rotate crank anti-clock wise.
2. ‘z’ - > To rotate crank clock wise.
3. ‘+’ and ‘-‘ - > To speed up and speed down
4. ‘o’ - > Transparency.
5. ‘0’ and 1’ - > Right light and Left light respectively
6. ‘s’ and ‘t’ - > Shading and Texture respectively
